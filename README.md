# WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?
*(https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=763745)*

<div style="text-align: justify"><h4>The article was interesting as it discussed why software engineering is called engineering. Furthermore, I didn't know that initial developers wanted to call it as software physics. However, it was named as engineering because the term was already in use. The engineering term got stuck and is with us till date. Nevertheless, the article says and I agree, to some extent, that software production is not exactly engineering despite the fact that there might be some principles of engineering which can be significant in building a software. I liked the analogy made by the author in the article: "A software engineer is no more an engineer than a novelist is a word engineer." Furthermore, I stand by the author's opinion that maybe we are better off naming software engineering as "software production techniques" or some such.</h4></div>

I think you noted a good point that was also mentioned in the article that to some extennt software production is not completely engineering. </h4></div>
