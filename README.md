# Git & GitHub Workflow Practice

Article: [What is Software Engineering](https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=763745), by Bill Curran (Ubiquity, Volume 2001 Issue October)

## Response

The article was interesting as it discussed why software engineering is called engineering. Furthermore, I didn't know that initial developers wanted to call it as software physics. However, it was named as engineering because the term was already in use. The engineering term got stuck and is with us till date. Nevertheless, the article says and I agree, to some extent, that software production is not exactly engineering despite the fact that there might be some principles of engineering which can be significant in building a software. I liked the analogy made by the author in the article: "A software engineer is no more an engineer than a novelist is a word engineer." Furthermore, I stand by the author's opinion that maybe we are better off naming software engineering as "software production techniques" or some such.

## Comment

This document was not written in proper Markdown. It contained mostly `HTML`. I have removed the `HTML` code and fixed the Markdown.

When writing a formatted document with Markdown, there is usually no reason to write `HTML` code. The purpose of Markdown is to allow you to quickly write a formatted document with minimal code.

Also, the document showed the URL (i.e. web address) of the article, but not the article title, author, publication date, etc. When referring to an article in any writing you do - formal or informal -, you should give some kind of fuller reference to the article. You don't have to follow [AMA citation guidelines](https://www.scribbr.com/ama/ama-website-citation/) for how to write a reference for this course, but it should still be more than just a raw link URL. I've fixed that as well.

What Dixit talks about here about software engineering is quite interesting. I believe this article further solidifies my long held belief that software engineering isn't purely an area of study, rather it is a set of best practices and tools for collaborative workflow. This is also similar to what the professor discussed in class. The author stating how software engineering isn't 'one size fits all' but rather trying to include all of software engineering into one thing would be similar to combining mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering together also stands out, and gives a clear sense as to the topic's broadness.
